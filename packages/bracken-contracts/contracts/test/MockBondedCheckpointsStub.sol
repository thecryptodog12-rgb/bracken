/**
 * @title MockBondedCheckpointsStub
 * @notice A bonded history and its registry in one contract, for tests that only need
 * `BondedVotes` to get PAST the history binding rather than to read any bond.
 *
 * @dev `BondedVotes` binds token, registry and history in its constructor: the history must share
 * the token's clock, and the registry that wrote it must bond the same token. Satisfying that with
 * the real contracts means a full system deployment plus a bonding-asset rotation, which is more
 * than a test of a LATER constructor check needs. This answers `registry()` with itself and
 * `getCiphernodeBondToken()` with whatever token the test is binding, so the checks pass and
 * construction reaches the one being measured.
 *
 * Records no history: `bonded` and `getPastBonded` are zero. A test that needs bonded weight must
 * use the real `BondedCheckpoints`.
