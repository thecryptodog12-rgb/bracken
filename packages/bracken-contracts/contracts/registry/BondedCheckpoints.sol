/**
 * @title BondedCheckpoints
 * @notice Historical bonded-collateral totals for `BondingRegistry`.
 *
 * @dev Bonded BRACKEN is transferred to the registry, which never delegates it. Under ERC20Votes an
 * undelegated balance carries no voting power, so an operator forfeits that weight entirely —
 * while the bonded tokens still count in the token's total supply and so raise the quorum
 * denominator they cannot help meet.
 *
 * The history lives here rather than on the registry because `BondingRegistry` is within a few
 * hundred bytes of the EIP-170 limit and cannot hold it. Keeping only the write call there also
 * keeps the read surface — this contract — replaceable without touching the registry's storage.
 *
 * Timepoints are `block.timestamp`, matching `BrackenToken`'s ERC-6372 `mode=timestamp` clock.
 * A block-number key would silently disagree with the token's own checkpoints, and an adapter
 * summing the two would report a number for two unrelated points in time.
