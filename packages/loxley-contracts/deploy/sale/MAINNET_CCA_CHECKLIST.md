# Mainnet CCA Deployment Checklist

This is the deployment-only checklist for the mainnet FOLD + Uniswap CCA launch.
Do not use it as the post-auction migration, exit, or claim checklist.

## Mainnet Addresses

Confirm these before touching mainnet:

- [ ] Foundation Safe / owner / unsold token recipient / proceeds recipient / LP
      position recipient: `0x5429D8c7fD14023f3c414126F94BbE25A05fC018`
- [ ] ETH currency sentinel: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- [ ] Uniswap LiquidityLauncher v3.0.0:
      `0x00004c4ccc709Ef590F7C81102C0689F0263D4e9`
- [ ] Uniswap LBPStrategy v3.0.0 mainnet:
      `0xb98766A35cdc28415be0767D4EA41e39fBA3e000`
- [ ] Uniswap CCA factory v2.0.0: `0x00cCa200BF124dBfA848937c553864f4B4CE0632`
- [ ] Predicate registry mainnet matches the Predicate dashboard and
      `PREDICATE_REGISTRY`.
- [ ] Predicate policy ID matches the mainnet Application Compliance dashboard
      verification hash.
- [ ] Operator / deployer wallet address is written down and added as a Safe
      proposer.

## 1. Safe And Operator

- [ ] Foundation Safe exists.
- [ ] Foundation Safe address is exactly
      `0x5429D8c7fD14023f3c414126F94BbE25A05fC018`.
- [ ] Operator wallet is funded with mainnet ETH for gas only.
- [ ] Operator wallet is added as a Safe proposer.
- [ ] Operator proposer access has been tested in the Safe UI before launch.
- [ ] Operator wallet is not a Safe signer unless intentionally approved.
- [ ] Safe owners are online and know they must approve and execute the
      activation batch immediately after deployment.

## 2. Environment

- [ ] `PRIVATE_KEY` is the operator wallet.
- [ ] `SAFE_ADDRESS=0x5429D8c7fD14023f3c414126F94BbE25A05fC018`.
- [ ] `SAFE_API_KEY` is set.
- [ ] `RPC_URL` points to Ethereum mainnet.
- [ ] `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is set.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, `PREDICATE_REGISTRY` is the mainnet Predicate
      registry from the dashboard.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, `PREDICATE_POLICY_ID` is the mainnet policy
      verification hash.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled,
      `PREDICATE_ATTESTATION_URL=https://api.predicate.io/v2/attestation`.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, `PREDICATE_CHAIN=ethereum`.
- [ ] `PREDICATE_API_KEY` is present only in backend/operator env, not
      committed.

## 3. Config

Config file:

```bash
packages/loxley-contracts/deploy/sale/mainnet-sale.config.json
```

Required values:

- [ ] `name = loxley-mainnet-cca`.

## 4. Time Model

- [ ] FOLD lifecycle uses timestamps.
- [ ] CCA auction mechanics use block numbers.
- [ ] `plan` derives CCA block numbers from configured timestamps.
- [ ] Pre-sale / FOLD `CCA_START`: July 6, 2026 at 10:00 AM US Eastern.
- [ ] Auction start: July 8, 2026 at 10:00 AM US Eastern.
- [ ] Auction end: July 10, 2026 at 10:00 AM US Eastern.
- [ ] UTC pre-sale / FOLD `CCA_START`: July 6, 2026 at 14:00 UTC.
- [ ] UTC auction start: July 8, 2026 at 14:00 UTC.
- [ ] UTC auction end: July 10, 2026 at 14:00 UTC.
- [ ] `NO_MORE_LOCKS` is `CCA_END + 40 days + 4 years + 30 days`.
- [ ] Expected mainnet `NO_MORE_LOCKS` is September 17, 2030 at 14:00 UTC.
- [ ] `claimBlock = migrationBlock`.
- [ ] Plan output shows `migrationBlock >= endBlock`.

## 5. Prepare

  --config ./deploy/sale/mainnet-sale.config.json \
  --predicate-registry "$PREDICATE_REGISTRY" \
  --predicate-policy-id "$PREDICATE_POLICY_ID"
```

If Predicate is not enabled, omit `--predicate-registry` and
`--predicate-policy-id`.

Check:

- [ ] Config file is written under `packages/loxley-contracts/deploy/sale`.
- [ ] Infra file is written under `packages/loxley-contracts/deploy/sale`.
- [ ] `saleDeployer.protocolAdmin = Foundation Safe`.

- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, PredicateValidationHook owner is Foundation Safe.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, PredicateValidationHook policy ID equals
      dashboard verification hash.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, add the PredicateValidationHook address to the
      Predicate Application Compliance dashboard.
- [ ] If Predicate is enabled, dashboard accepts the hook contract.

## 6. Plan

## 7. Deploy

Run:

```bash
pnpm sale --network mainnet --action deploy \

- [ ] Predicate verification path is confirmed on the Uniswap UI, if enabled.
- [ ] Foundation Safe owners have the deployment file, plan file, Safe proposal,
      FOLD address, auction address, and Uniswap URL.
- [ ] Team announcement uses the verified Uniswap mainnet auction URL.
