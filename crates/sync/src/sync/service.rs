    // the node was still holding. So "an E3 finished while we were offline" needs no special
    // handling here — it is reconciled by replaying the canonical chain state.
    //
    // What is intentionally NOT auto-re-driven *here in sync* is this node's *own* in-flight
    // request work by replaying the originating request events. Blindly re-publishing the
    // originating request event is a no-op: the event bus dedups by EventId (payload hash), so
    // the replayed event is dropped. Forcibly minting a fresh EventId to force re-execution is
    // unsafe on a value-bearing protocol (it can double-emit or race the canonical chain state)

    // Note: this is *not* a global absence of restart recovery. Actors that hold determined,
    // idempotent in-flight results re-drive themselves when `EffectsEnabled` is broadcast at the
    // end of this sync (e.g. `ThresholdKeyshare::resume_in_flight_work` re-publishes a computed
    // keyshare / decryption share). What sync deliberately avoids is replaying *request* events.

    // Detection of loose ends that cannot be locally re-driven is exposed offline and

    // slots against terminal events in the log and reports orphaned tickets. See
